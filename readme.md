# Simple Webpack Config

This package will extract and minifiy images (inc SVG), compile SCSS into CSS and obvs compile all the JS down to `bundle.js`

It's a work in progress. Need to add some dev options (source maps) etc.

## Notes

Three hours wasted, before realising I needed to set `url: false` so images in css don't break everything...FFS
